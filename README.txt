Knight Movers DFW — Email-Safe Package
This folder has no .js files (script is inlined into index.html) so it won't trip Gmail's executable/archives filter.
Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- assets/

Tip: For sharing with clients or collaborators, upload the folder to:
- Google Drive (Share link)
- Netlify/Cloudflare Pages (drag-and-drop)
- GitHub Pages (push repo, enable Pages)


How to add real Reviews later:
1) Open index.html and search for "Customer Reviews" (it's inside an HTML comment).
2) Remove the surrounding <!-- and --> to un-comment the section.
3) Add blockquotes like:
   <blockquote>“They moved us from Plano to Dallas in 4 hours.” <footer>— M. Garcia</footer></blockquote>
4) Save and redeploy.
